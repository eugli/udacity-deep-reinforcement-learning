For this project, I trained a set of 20 agents to each control an arm to move to a target location in the Unity [Reacher](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher) environment.

In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.

For this project, we will provide you with two separate versions of the Unity environment:

- The first version contains a single agent.
- The second version contains 20 identical agents, each with its own copy of the environment. <-- (the version I selected)

The second version is useful for algorithms like PPO, A3C, and D4PG that use multiple (non-interacting, parallel) copies of the same agent to distribute the task of gathering experience.

The barrier for solving the second version of the environment is slightly different, to take into account the presence of many agents. In particular, your agents must get an average score of +30 (over 100 consecutive episodes, and over all agents). Specifically,

After each episode, we add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting), to get a score for each agent. This yields 20 (potentially different) scores. We then take the average of these 20 scores.
This yields an average score for each episode (where the average is over all 20 agents).

The environment is considered solved, when the average (over 100 episodes) of those average scores is at least +30.

### Getting Started
The environment is based on [Unity ML-agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents).

#### 1: Clone the DRLND Repository
1.  Clone [the DRLND GitHub repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning#dependencies) from Udacity.
2. Follow the instructions in the README to configure the necessary dependencies--Python, PyTorch, Numpy, ML-Agents, etc.

#### 2: Download the Unity Environment
1. Download the environment from one of the links below. You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:

    - **_Option 2: Twenty (20) Agents_**
        - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Linux.zip)
        - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher.app.zip)
        - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Windows_x86.zip)
        - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Windows_x86_64.zip)
    
	(_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

	(_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Linux_NoVis.zip) (version 1) or [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Linux_NoVis.zip) (version 2) to obtain the "headless" version of the environment.  You will **not** be able to watch the agent without enabling a virtual screen, but you will be able to train the agent.  (_To watch the agent, you should follow the instructions to [enable a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md), and then download the environment for the **Linux** operating system above._)

3. Place the file in the DRLND GitHub repository, in the `p2_continuous-control/` folder, and unzip (or decompress) the file. 

### Explanation
My solution for this environment uses the actor-critic DDPG algorithm with fixed targets (for both actor and critic), soft updates, experienced replay, and added Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck noise. The agents are each created with four internal networks: a Q network, a deterministic policy network, a target Q network, and a target policy network.

The Q network and the target Q network have identical architectures: 3 fully-connected layers joined by ReLU activation functions. The final output is entered into a tanh activation function.

The policy network and target policy network also have identical architectures: 3 fully-connected layers joined by ReLU activation functions.

The agents each use a discount rate of 0.99.

The agents are each trained in a training loop for either 1000 episodes (with a max of 1000 timesteps each) or when they collectively reach an average reward over 100 episodes of 30.0 or greater.
